                        <p>Part of our founding principles of our business was our understanding of the partnership that Orange shares in our customers business, and that the price and delivery of our product is the difference between you making your product, shipping your order, and getting the bid for the job.<br><br>

    It is for this reason that Orange can confidentaly stand behind a 15 DAY Best Price Guarantee.  We know we are the best, but to help put your mind at ease and let you order the products you need now, delivered today, and shop price later - we are offering the 15 day promise to let you shop with confidence.  If you find a lower advertised price on another website, or have been quoted, we want to know about it.  Bring it to our attention and we will gladly match their price - sometimes even beat it. <br><br>

    Simply put, if you see a lower advertised price within 15 days of purchase, we will refund the difference...</p><br><br>
