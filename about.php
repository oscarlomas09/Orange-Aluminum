                    <img src="img/logo-icon.png" style="float:left;max-width:150px;"/>
                    <p>Orange Aluminum was started in 2006 with the vision of offering the industries most dynamic selection of stocked aluminum extrusions online, with no minimums, and unparralled customer support.   This started with a focus on the customers demand in todays market place, bypresenting the products in the most simplest/understandable means, and offering the flexability the market demands.  We have over 50 years of collective experience in the Aluminum industry, there is no competitor online that  that can tout that knowledge and understanding - with this knowledge we have leveraged our product offering, services, and solutions to our customers.  </p>
                    <p>There are many companies that would argue that they are a competitor to Orange, however not one of them has the inventory, selection, experience and accessibility to the network of extruders that we do.  This point is our case, many people have tried to enter the online market with selling products, but most fail in comparison.  Whether because they don't have stock of the profiles they promise, or they don't have the supplier agreements with their mills like we do, the fact is this industry is managing a commodity and no one knows it like Orange.  We started online, and have grown into our facility offering full fabrication operations in addition to same day delivery via our own trucks.  Our growth is the purest proof of our success, and we hope that we can show you our quality of service, and understanding of your needs in this demanding business market. With a staff of 3 , we have become nearly 20 and are only continuing to grow larger by the day.</p>
