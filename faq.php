                    <strong>I need a product in a different finish, is this possible?</strong>
                    <p><a>Contact Us</a> right away for help with your project. We can match any color and finish that you need.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>What is the lead time for a custom order?</strong>
                    <p>For any material that is not a regular stock item or a stocked length or finish, there is a 1-2 week lead time. This can vary due to many factors, so <a>contact us</a> for any questions about your custom order.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>What is the cost for a custom die to be made?</strong>
                    <p>We are limited to extrusions that fit within a 3 inch diameter circle. As long as they can, we can create any shape that you can dream of. Tooling for new dies varies depending on the complexity of the shape, cavities and wall thicknesses. Generally, solid dies start at $600 and hollow dies start at $1600. <a>Contact us</a> for any questions!</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>How much is the anodizing cost for mill finish material?</strong>
                    <p>Anodizing is done by an outside company. Generally, there is a minimum lot charge of $400 that is applied to every customly-anodized material. This does not apply to any of our material that is advertised as anodized or powder coated.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>I need a cut length longer/shorter than listed, is this possible?</strong>
                    <p>We stock some of our material in 12 foot lengths--give us a call, <a>email</a> or <a>contact us</a> and ask us about any longer lengths. If material is not stocked in the length that you are looking for, we can always produce it in just about any length necessary. We also have several saws in-house and can cut down any of our material.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>Is there a cutting charge?</strong>
                    <p>Cutting charges vary depending on the number of cuts and the precision/tolerance you seek. They range from $25-$100 for small orders. <a>Drop us a line</a> and we can create a custom quote.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>What is the maximum length for ground shipping?</strong>
                    <p>All material under 10 feet (120 inches) can be shipped via FedEx Ground and Express. Any packages exactly 10 feet (120 inches) or longer must be shipped via Freight. We also have a will call option as well as same-day delivery for large packages in the Southern California area.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>Same day shipping?</strong>
                    <p>If you live in our <a>local delivery zone</a> and we receive your order before 11 am Monday through Friday, we can have your package delivered the same day for $15 per box. Any orders received after 11 am will be delivered the next day. This applies to any package up to 12 feet long!.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>I placed an order for will-call. Where can i pick up?</strong>
                    <p>There are 2 locations for will call: one in Orange, Ca and one in North Long Beach, Ca. Your location will depend upon the items ordered. We will email the location once the order is placed.

                    <strong>What is the shipping time to ____ ?</strong>
                    <p>We use FedEx for ground, express and freight shipments. Their transit map will give you an idea of ground shipping times.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>How soon will my order ship out?</strong>
                    <p>Most orders ship within 24 hours. Although we make our best efforts not to, from time to time we do run low on our stocked items. We can generally replenish our stock within 1 week and will notify you immediately if this happens.</p>

                    <strong>What is the difference between mill finish, powder coat, clear anodized, and mechanically polished?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mill – The natural/raw appearance of the aluminum as it is extruded. No secondary process, may show heavy production lines.</li>
                        <li>Anodizing – Electrochemical process that is corrosion resistant and protects the material from oxidizing. We offer clear anodizing, which creates a matte finish, and brite-dip anodizing that creates a shiny, shimmery finish.</li>
                        <li>Powder Coat – Electrostatically applied powder paint provides a .001-.003” ‘skin’ like surface over the metal that is both decorative and protective.</li>
                        <li>Mechanical Polish – Process that buffs out the surface finish to create a smooth, mirror-ish appearance. Does not protect the material from oxidizing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>What is the difference between 6061-T6, 6063-T5, and 6463-T5?</strong>
                    <p>This represents the alloy and temper of the material. The first four digits are the alloy followed by the temper.<br><i>Alloy</i> – This is the metal grade, in the case of our aluminum we offer three grades; 6061, 6063, and 6463</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>6061 – Considered a structural alloy ideal for strength based applications or machining.</li>
                        <li>6063 – Considered an architectural alloy that is ideal for visual and aestheticapplications, and still provides a little over half the strength as 6061.</li>
                        <li>6463 – Considered a brite dip alloy, specially engineered for brite anodize finishes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><i>Temper</i> – Represents the rigidity of the extrusion as it has been heat treated. <br>Material rigidity can range from pliable (T1 – low heat treat that is naturally aged) to rigid (T5 – cooled from an elevated temperature and artificially aged).</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>Do you have certificates of conformance available?</strong>
                    <p>We are more than happy to provide certificates of conformance for any of our material upon request. Please note that we do not certify T6 material, as it is a best-attempt at T6 temper.</p>
                    <br>

                    <strong>Is there a minimum order required?</strong>
                    <p>None! You can order any amount from our website without fear of minimum charges.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>What is the minimum amount needed to receive a discount?</strong>
                    <p>This depends greatly on the part, finish and length that you are looking for. Unfortunately, there is no one answer. <a>Contact Us</a> for any special or large orders.</p>
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>Can the material be made flexible enough to bend around corners?</strong>
                    <p>Absolutely! We can have material created in a custom soft temper that will leave it malleable enough to be bent around any shape--table tops, mirrors, and frames to name a few. As material hardens over time, we cannot stock soft temper material and can only create it per order. Contact us for more info.</p>

                    <strong>How do you install panel rails and clips?</strong>
                    <p>You clip the back one in, you clip the front one in and you raise it all about. Our handy video installation guide is coming soon!</p>
